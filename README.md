===Goal Of The App===
The goal of the app is to make it easier for people to research in a easier and less complex way,
It is mainly helpful for secondary research, primary data analysis(from surveys etc.) and mathematical functions needed for
development of research.

===Functions===
1.Defining or meaning of word
	This is self explanatory. To find the definition of a word. simply type "definition of <word>", "definition <word>", "meaning of <word>" or

==List functions==
This functions create lists, add items to lists, remove items from lists and view list.These Lists are stored on storage not RAM so if you close the 
program and re-open the program the list data will still be there. the list function can be used to manage tasks that you can do for a day

	Type "create list <name>".You can also type "create list" to create a list and it will ask you what you want to name it

11.Add to List
	Type "add to list" and it will ask you for the list name and the thing you want to add to the list

12.Remove from List
	Type "remove from list" and it will ask you for the list name and the thing you want to remove from the list

13.Get list
	Type "get list <name>" or "see list <name>" to see the list
===csv functions===
These functions are used to maniputlate csv files for data analysis.

14.Profanity Filter
	Type "clean". This function removes profanity in a csv file

15.Number Extract
	Type "extract integers" or "get numbers". It gets numbers from a csv file

16.Sentiment Extract
	Type "extract sentiment". This function will help you extract sentiment from a chosen csv file

17.topic
	Type "topic" this will find the topic of a certain row or column of a csv file

18.pie-chart
	Type "pie chart" to get the pie chart of a two columns in a csv file

19.line graph
	Type "line graph" to get the line graph of a two columns in a csv file

20.scatter-plot
	type "scatter plot" to get the scatter plot of a two columns in a csv file

===web and text functions===
